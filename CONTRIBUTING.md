# Contributing to the project

The branch management is as follows  
- [master](https://github.com/kevinam99/Project-Fifth-Estate):  
Branch for initial stages of development. Here you will find a lot of test codes we wrote and used while we were still setting up the project. This is **defunct**. Feel free to expeiment yourself.
- [firebase](https://github.com/kevinam99/Project-Fifth-Estate/tree/firebase):  
THis branch was created to test flows using Firebase over MongoDB. We found out that the implementation is rather simpler, efficient and straightforward when using MongoDB. **Defunct**
- [heroku](https://github.com/kevinam99/Project-Fifth-Estate/tree/heroku):  
This, here, is the *prod* branch where the backend of the project lives on Heroku. This contains the second-most updated state of the repo. This is an **active** branch.
- [ignoreGregFilter](https://github.com/kevinam99/Project-Fifth-Estate/tree/ignoreGregFilter):  
This branch was created to test flows wherein we would **NOT** look for the #greg in the Facebook posts that we would extract. Flows are explained further in the README.
- [restructure](https://github.com/kevinam99/Project-Fifth-Estate/tree/restructure):  
This branch has the most updated version of the code. This was first created because there was a need to restructure the project directory and then eventually, this was used to push the updated code. **Active**

Any other branches are just created to test approaches, features etc and are in no way related to the above branches yet.

This is the most updated branch. After a few features are built, they will be merged to the [Heroku](https://github.com/kevinam99/Project-Fifth-Estate/tree/heroku) branch which will trigger a build on Travis and upon passing the build, it will be deployed to Heroku.
The [src/services](./src/services/) folder contains the codes that perform the actions.

We don't intend to continue developing this project further since all of us working full time jobs, however, PRs are always welcome ðŸŽ‰. Please email any one of us when you do open a PR.
